To run the codes:
1) Type python3 lexer.py
    It will ask for input which could be given as any of the 3 testcases we have provided
    for instance input is test1.txt then it would generate the 'input.txt' file for the other code
2) Type python3 Parser.py
    No input is required for this as this automatically takes input.txt as the input and prints
    and saves the result in a csv file whose name can be changed from the Parser.py file line
    number 408
